# Energy Efficiency and Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) Analysis

This repository contains a reproducible data-driven analysis of Power Usage
Effectiveness (PUE) metrics across countries, integrating energy efficiency,
infrastructure performance, and regional characteristics.

### Purpose
The analysis supports evidence-based decision-making for improving energy
efficiency in critical infrastructure and aligns with U.S. national priorities
related to energy security, sustainability, and climate resilience.

### Methods
- Data cleaning and harmonization using Python
- Statistical analysis of PUE indicators
- Geospatial visualization using ArcGIS outputs
- Cross-country comparative analysis

### Relevance to National Interest
The methodology demonstrated here can be applied to:
- Energy-efficient infrastructure planning
- Grid optimization and demand forecasting
- Policy and investment prioritization
