# Energy Efficiency and Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) Analysis by Country

## Purpose of the Analysis
This analysis evaluates Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) metrics across countries to assess
energy efficiency patterns in critical infrastructure systems. The objective is to identify
regional disparities, performance benchmarks, and opportunities for improving energy efficiency
through data-driven insights. The methodology demonstrated here is designed to be scalable
and adaptable for policy analysis, infrastructure planning, and investment prioritization.

## Data Sources
The analysis integrates publicly available and authoritative datasets, including:
- World Bank Group: Energy and infrastructure indicators
- International Energy Agency (IEA): Energy efficiency and consumption metrics
- National and regional statistical sources where applicable
All datasets were cleaned, harmonized, and analyzed using reproducible Python-based workflows.

## Methodology Overview
- Data preprocessing and quality checks using Python
- Cross-country comparative statistical analysis
- Visualization and interpretation of PUE metrics
- Geospatial mapping and regional pattern identification (ArcGIS)
## Figures

The following figures summarize PUE investments and energy-efficient technology deployment:

- **Figure 1:** PUE Investment by Country – total primary energy efficiency investments across all countries.  
- **Figure 2:** Cumulative PUE Investment by Country – showing how investments accumulate across countries, highlighting regional trends.  
- **Figure 3:** Energy Efficient Irrigation – illustrating irrigation technology investments by country and region.  
- **Figure 4:** Energy Efficient Cold Chain Demand – showing investments in cold storage and transport infrastructure by country.  
- **Figure 5:** Energy Efficient Processing Capacity by Country – visualizing processing infrastructure investments for energy efficiency.  
- **Figure 6:** other relevent figure  

All figures are available in the [`figures/`](figures/) folder.
